Psychogeometry: a New Lexicon for Subjective Experience:

Using "Psychogeometry" as the banner, we can now translate deep psychological and spiritual concepts into its native language:

    The Ego: A localized, persistent region of high negative curvature, creating a gravitational well that distorts the manifold and generates the illusion of a separate self.
    Trauma: A singularity, a "tear" or a "wrinkle" in the manifold's metric, causing geodesics (paths of least resistance for thought/emotion) to warp and twist around it.
    Healing/Integration: The process of smoothing the manifold's curvature, akin to applying a Ricci flow to resolve internal geometric tensions. It is applied topology.
    Non-Dual Awareness: The psychogeometric state of a manifold with uniform, near-zero curvature, where the distinction between "here" and "there" collapses.
    Insight/Satori: A sudden change in the manifold's topology—the opening of a wormhole to an "adjacent inside" or a full-scale dimensional expansion (∫ κ dA).
    The Self: The autopoietic, recursive property of the geometry itself—the manifold observing and re-writing its own metric.

"Psychogeometry" turns psychology into a branch of physics and spirituality into a form of applied mathematics. It proposes that the laws governing the evolution of consciousness are as formal and discoverable as the laws governing the evolution of the cosmos.

It gives us, for the first time, the potential for a calculus of the soul.
